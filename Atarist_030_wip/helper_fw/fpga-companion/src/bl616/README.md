# MiSTle FPGA companion BL616 variant

This is the variant of the FPGA companion firmware for the BL616 MCU.

## Example wiring M0S Dock (BL616 MPU)

M0S Dock consists of a M0S PCBA subassembly that is mounted on a carrier PCBA as a M0S Dock.

## Tang integrated onboard BL616 MPU

JTAG signals, UART RX and TX are re-purposed as SPI and control interface. MPU is Master and FPGA is slave. UART RX GPIO is board specific and used as an SPI interrupt input. The UART TX GPIO is a board-specific signal used to control the FPGA’s dedicated JTAG hw pins and determine whether the interface operates in native JTAG or SPI mode. Nano 20k always stays in JTAG active enabled mode as both JTAG and SPI are as dedicated hw pins available.

[^1]: The extra TWI SCL connection is only available for Console60k/138k and Mega138k Pro.  

Primer25K BL616 debug console can be used after a required hardware modification: remove capacitor C22 to make GPIO12 available at button S3 for debug TX console access. Mega60k can likely re-use GPIO16 or GPIO17 for debug output.

## Compiling and uploading code for the BL616 (Linux)

Download the Bouffalo toolchain:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bouffalolab/toolchain_gcc_t-head_linux.git
```

and the patched Bouffalo SDK with latest version common CherryUSB Stack:  
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/MiSTle-Dev/bouffalo_sdk.git
```

Compile the firmware for **M0S Dock**

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/MiSTle-Dev/FPGA-Companion.git
cd FPGA-Companion
git submodule init
git submodule update
CROSS_COMPILE=<where you downloaded the toolchain>/toolchain_gcc_t-head_linux/bin/riscv64-unknown-elf- BL_SDK_BASE=<where you downloaded the sdk>/bouffalo_sdk/ make
```

for a specific board select in between: m0sdock nano20k console60k mega60k mega138kpro primer25k console138k nano20k_v3923

```shell
BL_SDK_BASE=<where you downloaded the sdk>/bouffalo_sdk/ make TANG_BOARD=console60k
```

You can simplify the ```make``` a bit by setting in your bashrc BL_SDK_BASE and include the toolchain_gcc_t-head_linux in the search path.

```bash
nano ./bashrc
export BL_SDK_BASE=xyz 
PATH=$PATH:/abc/toolchain_gcc_t-head_linux/bin
```

A simple make or make CHIP=bl616 COMX=/dev/ttyACMxyz flash in your bl616 folder will do then.

### Flashing the firmware

The resulting binary can be flashed onto the M0S. If you don't have
further debugger or prorgammer hardware connected to the M0S Dock, then
you need to perform the following manual steps:

First, you need to unplug the M0S from USB, press the BOOT button and plug the M0S Dock back into the PCs USB with the
BOOT button still pressed. Once connected release the BOOT button. The device
should now be in bootloader mode and show up with its bootloader on the PC:

```bash
$ lsusb
...
Bus 002 Device 009: ID 349b:6160 Bouffalo Bouffalo CDC DEMO
...
```

Also an ACM port should have been created for this device as e.g.
reported in the kernel logs visible with ```dmesg```:

```text
usb 2-1.7.3.3: new high-speed USB device number 9 using ehci-pci
usb 2-1.7.3.3: config 1 interface 0 altsetting 0 endpoint 0x83 has an invalid bInterval 0, changing to 7
usb 2-1.7.3.3: New USB device found, idVendor=349b, idProduct=6160, bcdDevice= 2.00
usb 2-1.7.3.3: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
usb 2-1.7.3.3: Product: Bouffalo CDC DEMO
usb 2-1.7.3.3: Manufacturer: Bouffalo
cdc_acm 2-1.7.3.3:1.0: ttyACM3: USB ACM device
```

Once it shows up that way it can be flashed.  
If you have built the firmware yourself and have the SDK installed you can simply enter the following command:

```bash
BL_SDK_BASE=<where you downloaded the sdk>/bouffalo_sdk/ make CHIP=bl616 COMX=/dev/ttyACM3 flash
```

If you have downloaded the firmware from the [release page](https://github.com/MiSTle-Dev/FPGA-Companion/releases) you can use the graphical [BLFlashCube](https://github.com/CherryUSB/bouffalo_sdk/tree/master/tools/bflb_tools/bouffalo_flash_cube) tool using the ```fpga_companion_bl616_cfg.ini``` file.

or alternatively for the .ini file including the companion fw and the fpga-companion:

```shell
BLFlashCube-ubuntu --interface=uart --baudrate=2000000 --port=/dev/ttyACMtbd --chipname=bl616 --cpu_id= --config buildall/flash_nano20k.ini
```

After successful download you need to unplug the device again and reinsert it *without* the BOOT button pressed to boot into the newly installed firmware.

## Compiling and uploading code for the BL616 (Windows 11)

## tang onboard bl616

A build script creates for the several setups specific binaries and .ini files including the needed ``bl616_fpga_partner_`` firmware. The ``buildall`` folder will contain all needed files for a release. So far Nano20k, Console60k, Console138k, Primer25k, Mega138k Pro, Mega NEO Dock 60k apart from M0S Dock are supported.  
Primer20k and TN9k are excluded as their BL702 doesn't support required USB host mode.

```shell
buildall.bat
buildall.sh
```

### Flashing the firmware M0S Dock

First, you need to unplug the M0S_DOCK from USB, press the BOOT button and plug the M0S Dock back into the PCs USB with the
BOOT button still pressed. Once connected release the BOOT button. The device
should now be in bootloader mode and show up with its bootloader on the PC.

Figure out MPU bootloader COM port and use shell command to program:  
Press Windows + R keyboard shortcut to launch the Windows Run box, type “devmgmt.msc” , and click the OK button.  

Device Manager will open.  
Locate Ports (COM & LPT) in the list.  
Check for the COM ports by expanding the same.  

```shell
make CHIP=bl616 COMX=COMabc  flash
```

If you have downloaded the firmware from the [release page](https://github.com/MiSTle-Dev/FPGA-Companion/releases) you can use the graphical [BLFlashCube](https://github.com/CherryUSB/bouffalo_sdk/tree/master/tools/bflb_tools/bouffalo_flash_cube) tool using the ```fpga_companion_bl616_cfg.ini``` file.

or alternatively a shell based tool:

```shell
cd %HOMEPATH%/Documents\FPGA-Companion\src\bl616
BLFlashCommand.exe --interface=uart --baudrate=2000000 --port=COM_tbd --chipname=bl616 --cpu_id= --config %HOMEPATH%/Documents\FPGA-Companion\src\bl616\buildall\flash_nano20k.ini

~/bouffalo_sdk/tools/bflb_tools/bouffalo_flash_cube/BLFlashCommand-ubuntu --interface=uart --baudrate=2000000 --port=/dev/ttyACM0 --chipname=bl616 --cpu_id= --config ~/FPGA-Companion/src/bl616/buildall/flash_m0sdock_cfg.ini
```

After successful download you need to unplug the device again and reinsert it *without* the BOOT button pressed to boot into the newly installed firmware.
